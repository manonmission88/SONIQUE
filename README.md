# Sonique - Voice-Interactive Learning Companion for Visually Impaired

## About the Project
Sonique is an AI-powered, voice-interactive learning companion designed for blind and visually impaired children. It transforms caregiver-uploaded educational materials into engaging audio lessons, enabling children to learn and interact using natural voice commands. Our mission is to make education accessible, independent, and joyfulâ€”without relying on screens or text.
